# Online Real time chat application - SSB
### Viraj Dissanayake

#### To run this Flask application:
Make sure that you have a copy of Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You’ll also need to install pip. If you downloaded Python from Python’s website, you likely already have pip installed (you can check by running pip in a terminal window). If you don’t have it installed, be sure to install it before moving on!

1) Download or clone the repository and unzip it.
2) In a terminal window, navigate into your project2 directory.
3) Run pip3 install -r requirements.txt in your terminal window to make sure that all of the necessary Python packages (Flask and Flask-SocketIO, for instance) are installed.
4) Set the environment variable FLASK_APP to be application.py. On a Mac or on Linux, the command to do this is export FLASK_APP=application.py. On Windows, the command is instead set FLASK_APP=application.py.
5) Run flask run to start the Flask application.
